- **Bookmarks**: Save favorite URLs and access them easily.
- **History Management**: Keeps track of visited websites along with timestamps.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid URLs or unavailable resources gracefully, displaying appropriate error messages.

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Tkinter**: GUI development for user interaction.
- **CefPython3**: For rendering web pages.
- **Socket Programming**: To send and receive HTTP requests.
